# PipeCraft Example: Gated Workflow

[![CI/CD Pipeline](https://github.com/the-craftlab/pipecraft-example-gated/actions/workflows/pipeline.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/the-craftlab/pipecraft-example-gated/actions/workflows/pipeline.yml)

Enterprise gated workflow with manual approvals at each stage.

## Purpose

This example demonstrates:

- ✅ **5-stage gated flow** - develop → alpha → beta → release → production
- ✅ **Manual approvals** - No auto-merge, all promotions via PR approval
- ✅ **Merge commits** - Creates merge commits (not fast-forward) for audit trail
- ✅ **Custom branch names** - alpha, beta, release instead of staging
- ✅ **Enterprise workflow** - Real-world approval process
- ✅ **Production-ready** - Starts at v1.0.0
- ✅ **4 domains** - services, web, api, shared

## Configuration

```json
{
  "branchFlow": ["develop", "alpha", "beta", "release", "production"],
  "mergeStrategy": "merge",
  "autoMerge": {
    "alpha": false,
    "beta": false,
    "release": false,
    "production": false
  },
  "domains": {
    "services": { "paths": ["services/**"] },
    "web": { "paths": ["web/**"] },
    "api": { "paths": ["api/**"] },
    "shared": { "paths": ["shared/**"] }
  }
}
```

## Workflow

### Stage 1: Development (develop branch)

```bash
git checkout develop
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
git push origin develop
```

**PipeCraft:**

- Runs tests
- Calculates version
- **Creates PR** to alpha (awaits approval)

### Stage 2: Alpha Testing (alpha branch)

**Manual Action Required:**

1. Review PR from develop → alpha
2. Approve and merge PR

**PipeCraft:**

- Runs tests on alpha
- **Creates PR** to beta (awaits approval)

### Stage 3: Beta Testing (beta branch)

**Manual Action Required:**

1. QA team reviews PR from alpha → beta
2. Runs acceptance tests
3. Approves and merges PR

**PipeCraft:**

- Runs tests on beta
- **Creates PR** to release (awaits approval)

### Stage 4: Release Candidate (release branch)

**Manual Action Required:**

1. Stakeholders review PR from beta → release
2. Final approval for production readiness
3. Approves and merges PR

**PipeCraft:**

- Runs final tests
- **Creates PR** to production (awaits approval)

### Stage 5: Production (production branch)

**Manual Action Required:**

1. DevOps/Release Manager reviews PR
2. Schedules deployment window
3. Approves and merges PR

**PipeCraft:**

- Creates version tag (e.g., v1.2.0)
- Triggers deployment

## Key Differences from Other Examples

| Feature        | Minimal      | Basic        | Nx           | Gated          |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | -------------- |
| Branches       | 2            | 3            | 3            | **5**          |
| Auto-merge     | ✅ Yes       | ✅ Yes       | ✅ Yes       | **❌ No**      |
| Merge Strategy | fast-forward | fast-forward | fast-forward | **merge**      |
| Approval Gates | None         | None         | None         | **All stages** |
| Use Case       | Quickstart   | Standard     | Complex      | **Enterprise** |

## Why Use Gated Workflow?

**Use when you need:**

- Human approval before production
- QA sign-off at specific stages
- Stakeholder review before release
- Audit trail with merge commits
- Scheduled deployment windows
- Compliance requirements

**Don't use if:**

- You want fast iteration
- Team is small (<5 people)
- CI/CD should be fully automated
- You practice continuous deployment

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/the-craftlab/pipecraft-example-gated.git
cd pipecraft-example-gated

# Test locally
npm test
npm run build

# Make a change
echo "export const newFeature = () => {};" >> services/auth-service.js
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new authentication feature"
git push origin develop

# Watch for PR creation
gh pr list
```

## Approval Process

### As a Developer

1. Push to `develop`
2. Wait for tests to pass
3. PR to `alpha` is created automatically
4. Notify QA team

### As QA Engineer

1. Review PRs targeting `beta`
2. Run manual acceptance tests
3. Approve if tests pass
4. Merge PR

### As Release Manager

1. Review PRs targeting `production`
2. Verify all gates passed
3. Schedule deployment
4. Approve and merge
5. Monitor deployment

## Troubleshooting

### PR Not Created

Check workflow logs:

```bash
gh run view --log | grep "create-pr"
```

Verify `autoMerge` is `false` in config.

### Tests Failing

Run locally first:

```bash
npm test
npm run build
```

### Merge Conflicts

Resolve in PR:

```bash
git checkout alpha
git merge develop
# Resolve conflicts
git push origin alpha
```
